//Your job is to write a program for a speed camera. For simplicity, ignore the details such as camera, sensors, etc and focus 
purely on the logic. Write a program that asks the user to enter the speed limit. Once set, the program asks for the speed of a 
car. If the user enters a value less than the speed limit, program should display Ok on the console. If the value is above the 
speed limit, the program should calculate the number of demerit points. For every 5km/hr above the speed limit, 1 demerit points 
should be incurred and displayed on the console. If the number of demerit points is above 12, the program should display 
License Suspended.
